# Hi, I'm Jiwon ðŸ‘‹

__I am a web developer and a beginner snowboarder.__

I'm interested in studying how to solve problems and enjoy making the system structure systematic.
Of course, I am more interested in my health and hobbies on the premise that "a healthy body has a healthy mind."
Usually, I train my physical strength while doing home fitness, and in winter, I play while snowboarding.

## ðŸŽ¨Things I code with

![Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/apache-%23D42029.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache&logoColor=white)
![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![jQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)

I work based on the APM stack. Technologies such as Docker, Nginx, and AWS' EC2, RDS, and S3 and Java Spring, Nodejs chat system, MQTT communication, and Vuejs are also used, but they are not at a level that can be controlled freely.
I'm using both the backend and the frontend, so is it okay to introduce me as a full stack? Ha ha.

## ðŸ“ŒThings I plan with

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-%23326ce5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

I'm going to learn JAVA and Spring according to Korean characteristics. The demand is so high that it seems to be the best choice.
Only the programming language I use changes, and I think I will still remain a backend developer.

And I'm going to study English, too!
I've used a translation program so far, but someday I want to write it myself.
